# Accessibility-Handbook
Final Year Project ~ Creative Computing @ IADT

## [View the Application](https://accessibility-handbook.herokuapp.com/#/)

### To Run on Local Machine 
You will need to follow these steps:

1. Download the zip or `git clone` to your machine.

2. Open the command prompt and `npm install` all the dependicies which are listed in the package.json.

3. Running a local Database on the network will require local setup and some changes in the server.js file, 
   a tutorial for that can be found at https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/.
   
4. This application uses Mongo Atlas, and can be accessed anywhere (by the admin). This means the app functions perfectly with CRUD  
   techniques going to the online DB and returning correct values.
   
5. Learn all about accessibility design principles, and view the code sandboxes as a demonstration for better understanding!

### The Study, Testing and Evaluation of Accessibility Design principles and tools practiced by the Top  Leading technology companies worldwide, with the intent of creating an interactive browser based reference library.

Are the Top 10 leading Technology Companies building products  with the intention of an equal experience for the widest audience possible? If so, how do they achieve this?

#### I would like to research this area, to compare and test with users, the different principles outlined by these companies.

My goal is to create a reference library that presents the best principles. I would like to display these principles using interactive examples and animations.

To gain a better understanding of this Accessibility Project, the following research was conducted. Beginning, the often grey area of naming conventions that surround this discipline will be explored, with detailed explanations of Universal Design, Inclusive Design and Accessibility Design.


Secondly, the project will cater to both Designer and Developer, using similar methods found in the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).
Set up by the The World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Accessibility Initiative has “a commitment to lead the Web to its full potential .. promoting a high degree of usability for people with disabilities.”
